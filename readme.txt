Project brief
-------------------------------------
The purpose of this project was to create a new issues view for Github. Using their api to pull data and display them on a responsive web page with a limit of 25 issues per page. The project consists of two parts. The first part is pull data from the api provided and display the issue title, issue number, label, user name, user avatar, and the first 140 characters of the issue ending on a clean word. The user should then be able to page through the next and previous 25 issues. The second part is once a user clicks on an issue it should open a new page with a detailed version of the issue. This page should include the issue title, state, labels, user name, user avatar, complete issue, and a list of comments if they exist.
